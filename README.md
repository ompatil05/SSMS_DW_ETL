1. **Bronze Layer**:Stores Raw Data as-in from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Database
2. **Silver Layer**:This Layer involves Data Transformation like Data Cleaning ,Standardization and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
3. **Gold Layer**:This layer contains Buisness Ready data for Analysis and Model Devlopment
